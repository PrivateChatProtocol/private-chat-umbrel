  Privacy Highlights

  🔒 No Message Storage: Messages are only relayed between participants and never stored.
  
  🚫 No Logs: Production mode disables all logging to prevent metadata leaks.
  
  🔗 No Third-Party Services: Operates independently without reliance on external services.
  
  📡 Encrypted Transmission: All communication is secured via encrypted WebSockets.
  
  🛠 Open Source: Full transparency — anyone can inspect and verify how Private Chat handles data.

  
  How It Works
  
  You select a nickname and a room and join. Every message you send is relayed to a backend server, encrypted using a secure WebSocket protocol. The server broadcasts your message to every participant in the room, leaving no logs, no trace, and storing no messages. When a participant leaves the room, the history is lost forever. Only new messages can be seen by the current chat participants.
